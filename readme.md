Yet another repository of [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/abouthttps://projecteuler.net/about) solutions.  Seems like a requirement these days when one has a Github account.

In this one I intend to solve each problem in multiple languages:

C, because C
Fortran, because old school is the best school (sometimes)
Java, because the language is not as bad as people fear
Python, to solve them in three lines but make everyone else's performance numbers look look good
Haskell, to learn me a Haskell for great good

I might add more languages later.  I would like, at some point, to use these problems to do side-by-side performance comparisons of these languages for numerical computing.  I realize this will require me to understand the best way to solve problems in the specific language, so it might be a while before the comparsion is realistic.  Also, I am going to avoid knowingly using specialized libraries.  Every solution should build or run with a standard distribution of the respective languages.
